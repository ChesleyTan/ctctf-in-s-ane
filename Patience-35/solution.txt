This was fun. When you download the file, you find something very fishy -- it's
a gif, which is weird since it looks like a static barcode. So let's disassemble
it:

>>> gifsicle -e patience.gif

The output of which is in the subfolder "patience," on the last frame you'll see
the real flag:

not_the_barcode
