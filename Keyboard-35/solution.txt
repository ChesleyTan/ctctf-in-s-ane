This is a substitution cipher, so to make our lives easier, let's use an
automated tool, the amazing http://www.quipqiup.com/index.php

After decrypting, we get 
IO CRYPTOGRAPHY, A SUBSTITUTIOO CIPHER IS A METHOD OF EOCODIOG BY WHICH UOITS OF
PLAIOTEXT ARE REPLACED WITH CIPHERTEXT, ACCORDIOG TO A REGULAR SYSTEM; THE
'UOITS' MAY BE SIOGLE LETTERS (THE MOST COMMOO), PAIRS OF LETTERS, TRIPLETS OF
LETTERS, MIXTURES OF THE ABOVE, AOD SO FORTH. FOR THE FLAG, IT'S ~EEPITCLEAO

Clearly, some of the necessary substitutions are still missing, but we have
enough information to extrapolate what they are. Making the substitution of N
for O in various places and K for ~, we get:

IN CRYPTOGRAPHY, A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER IS A METHOD OF ENCODING BY WHICH
UNITS OF PLAINTEXT ARE REPLACED WITH CIPHERTEXT, ACCORDIOG TO A REGULAR SYSTEM;
THE 'UNITS' MAY BE SINGLE LETTERS (THE MOST COMMON), PAIRS OF LETTERS, TRIPLETS
NF LETTERS, MIXTURES OF THE ABOVE, AOD SO FORTH. FOR THE FLAG, IT'S
KEEPITCLEAN

So our flag is: KEEPITCLEAN
