Fire up JD-GUI to decompile Javatar.class

Upon decompiling, we can see that we have to input WHOISTHEJAVATAR in order to
get the decrypted flag, so let's run the program and give it WHOISTHEJAVATAR as
an argument. At this point, we may run into problems due to java compiler version
mismatches, so we can just recompile it using this decompiled source code. Now,
we can run it and we get the flag:

>> java Javatar WHOISTHEJAVATAR
KELVINISTHEJAVATAR
