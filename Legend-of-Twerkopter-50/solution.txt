The way this competition frame their flags is really chessing me off...

Ok so we know that .xap files are basically .zip files. So we unzip, then we
just open WMAppManifest.xml, and at the very bottom, WITH NO INDICATION THAT
IT'S THE FLAG, we find the flag:
<!-- XAP_for_XNA -->

so the flag is
XAP_for_XNA
